                        questions about the patient's age and tobacco habits. The purpose of this test is to increase

                        seek medical care for their reported symptoms for early diagnosis. Below is a summary of how

            <h4>Cough</h4>
            <p>Coughing is a way for the airways to try to get rid of things that irritate them. Most often, the cough
                is due to a cold and then it goes away by itself, although it can take several weeks. Coughing can also
                be caused by other diseases of the airways or lungs, or by irritants such as smoke. Coughing up blood
                should always be evaluated by a doctor. An infection is often the cause, but other conditions should be
                ruled out.</p>

            <h4>Shortness of breath</h4>
            <p>Shortness of breath may not be anything to worry about, but sometimes it can be serious and require
                medical help. Common causes include asthma, respiratory tract infections like pneumonia, obesity, and
                smoking. It can also be a sign of a panic attack. However, in some cases, it may indicate something more
                serious, such as a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer.
            </p>

            <h4>Wheezing</h4>
            <p>Wheezing is the sound you hear when your airway is partially blocked. This blockage can result from
                various conditions such as allergic reactions, colds, bronchitis, or allergies. Additionally, wheezing
                can be a symptom of asthma, pneumonia, heart failure, and other conditions. It may resolve on its own,
                but it can also indicate a serious underlying condition.</p>

            <h4>Hoarseness</h4>
            <p>When you're hoarse, your voice doesn't sound as it normally does. It's common to experience hoarseness
                with a cold, but it can also result from overstraining your voice. In most cases, the problem resolves
                on its own.</p>

            <h4>Swollen lymph nodes</h4>
            <p>Swollen lymph nodes are common. They might feel tender and bigger than usual. This happens when your
                immune system activates to defend your body against viruses and bacteria. It is recommended to have
                swollen lymph nodes evaluated by a doctor if they accompany an infected wound, if they are larger than
                1.5 centimeters in size without ongoing severe throat infection, if they feel firm or fixed, or if you
                have swollen lymph nodes in multiple areas of your body along with symptoms such as pallor, fatigue or
                fever.</p>

            <h4>Repeated or persistent chest infections</h4>
            <p>Respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, affect your airways and lungs. Pneumonia is
                typically caused by bacteria, which is treated with antibiotics. If you experience frequent episodes of
                these infections, it could indicate an underlying health issue.</p>

            <h4>Chest or shoulder pain</h4>
            <p>Chest and shoulder pain can have various causes. It can for example be due to gallstones, angina pectoris
                or other heart diseases. It also may result from inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis), the
                pleura (pleuritis) or the pancreas (pancreatitis). If you're experiencing unexplained pain in your chest
                or shoulder that persists, it's important to visit your doctor for evaluation.</p>
